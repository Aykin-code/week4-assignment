# REFLECTION

For what looked like a straightforward assignment, I again went dow some rabbit holes.

The database connection to the supabase DB went ok.

But pulling and displaying the reviews info was harder than it should have been.
e.g.
One missing '}' near the top of my CSS broke my layout and I (again) wasted wayyy to much time chasing it down.

I had issues with unwanted columns overlaps & padding, went round in cirlces on the layout and duplicated blocks of CSS more than once.

I think I rebuilt the the CSS file more than 3 times from scratch!
In the end, time constaints made me settle on something very basic. with more time I would have made this a lot more prettier.
